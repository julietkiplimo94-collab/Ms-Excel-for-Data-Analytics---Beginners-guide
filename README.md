# Ms-Excel-for-Data-Analytics---Beginners-guide #
If you are a beginner in using Excel for analysis and visualisation, this article is for you. It will give you all the basics you need to grasp to help you get started with your first project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ms Excel is a Powerful tool developed by Microsoft that enables you to store, organize, analyze, and visualize data. It is a spreadsheet that organizes data in Rows, Columns and cells.

It is a useful tool for data analytics that makes it easy to derive insights from large datasets.

In this article, I will walk you through the different functions, formulas, charts, and Pivot tables and dashboards.

**Below is an example of an Excel Interface:**

### Let's define a few terms ###

- **Workbook**: Is a collection of spreadsheets.

- **Worksheet/spreadsheets:** is a page or sheet in the Workbook where data can be entered and manipulated using functions and formulas.

- **Cell:** This is an Intersection between a row and a column where you can input data.

- **Dataset:** A collection of related data arranged in Rows and Columns stored in a workbook.

- **Range:** Is a collection of cells that can be used to perform formulas and functions.

- **Chart**: Is a graphical visualisation tool that displays data, e.g., a linegraph or Piechart. It works by plotting data points on a graph.

- **Dashboard:** Is a single page that displays all relevant charts and Key Insights at a glance.

- **Pivot charts:** These are summary tables extracted from a large dataset that help to derive useful insights.

## 1. Formulas and Functions ##

***Formulas*** are special equations that allow you to calculate values on a spreadsheet.

> All formulas must start with an equal sign (=).

Formulas contain the following basic math operators:
- Addition: +  e.g A1+B1
- Subtraction: -  e.g A1-B1
- Multiplication: *  e.g A1*B1
- Division: / e.g A1/B1

***Functions*** are special inbuilt formulas that have been created by Excel to manipulate data on a spreadsheet.

**> Examples of Functions include:**

- **IF()**: Is a logical function that will output data according to a specific test/condition. If the condition e.g =if(A1<10,"Low","High")

- **AVERAGE()**: Is a function that calculates the average of a range of cells that contains a list of values. e.g =AVERAGE(A1:A10)

- **SUMIF()**: Is a function that calculates the totals of a specific product and outputs them in a specified column. e.g =sumif(A:A,"Pencils",B:B)

- **COUNT()**: Is a function that counts the number of cells in a specific range of values. It helps to determine the size of a list of items.
e.g = COUNT(A1:A50)

**2. Data Validation & Conditional Formatting:**

These are tools that allow you to customize how your data appears in a spreadsheet.

***Data Validation***: is an inbuilt feature that allows users to restrict the data that is entered into a cell. This ensures the data is accurate and consistent. Examples of data validation include: "Decimals", "Whole number" etc

***Conditional formatting***: Is an inbuilt feature that allows a user to apply a specific formatting criteria to a cell or range of cells.

**3. Filtering & Sorting:**

**Filtering**: Is a tool found in the data tab that allows you to display data according to a specified Criteria.

**Sorting**: Is a tool also found in the data tab that allows you to arrange data in a specific order or criteria e.g sorting in ascending or descending order.

**4. Data Preparation & Cleaning:**

•	Removing Duplicates: Using the Remove duplicates built-in tool to find and delete redundant records.

•	Text Transformation: Functions like TRIM remove extra spaces, formatting all data fields appropriately, using the Format cells option.

•	Standardization: Functions such as UPPER, LOWER, and PROPER fix inconsistent text formatting.


There you go, you have learned the basics on how to manipulate your data on Ms Excel as a data analyst.

Adios, until the next one.
